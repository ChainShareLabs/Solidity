# Welcome to the world of Solidity! üëã

![Solidity Logo](logo.webp)

>This repository is designed to provide you with a quick introduction to the Solidity language, as well as links to useful tutorials to get you started. Solidity is a smart contract-oriented programming language, used primarily to develop decentralized applications (`dApps`) on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is Solidity? ü§î

>`Solidity` is a high-level programming language specially designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is heavily influenced by the syntax of popular languages such as JavaScript and C++, making the transition easier for developers familiar with these languages. [Smart contracts](https://github.com/ChainShareLabs/SmartContracts/blob/main/README.md) written in Solidity are executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can interact with other contracts and digital assets on the blockchain.
